# House Prices Prediction (Kaggle - Advanced Regression Techniques)

This project tackles the **House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques** competition on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques), where the goal is to predict the final sale price of homes in Ames, Iowa, using various features like property characteristics, location, and quality indicators.

---

## Project Overview

* **Problem Type:** Supervised Regression
* **Goal:** Predict `SalePrice` of houses based on structured input data
* **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, LightGBM

---

## Dataset

* **Train Set:** 1460 rows × 81 columns
* **Test Set:** 1459 rows × 80 columns
* Features include numerical, ordinal, and nominal categorical variables.

---

## 🔍 Workflow Summary

### 1. Data Loading & EDA

* Loaded `train.csv` and `test.csv`
* Inspected data types, distributions, and missing values
* Performed detailed feature analysis, including ordinal and nominal identification

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

* Imputed missing values based on domain logic (e.g. group-wise median for `LotFrontage`)
* Mapped ordinal features manually using dictionaries
* Encoded nominal features using category types for LightGBM compatibility

### 3. Model Training

* Used LightGBM with categorical feature support
* Log-transformed target variable to normalize skew
* Performed hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation

### 4. Evaluation

* Used RMSE on log-transformed target for validation
* Achieved final evaluation using the best iteration count from CV

### 5. Submission

* Applied the final model to the test set
* Inverted the log transformation for predictions
* Saved predictions to `submission.csv` for Kaggle submission

## Feature Importance

Used LightGBM’s gain-based and split-based feature importance to select the top 30 features, retrained the model using these for optimal performance.
